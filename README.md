# EZdog
*Extended, Extensible, ESM-based Zdog - a Round, flat, designer-friendly pseudo-3D engine*

Based on https://github.com/metafizzy/zdog

## API

See https://zzz.dog/api

## Why EZdog?

The "E" stands for **E**SM, **E**xtended, **E**xtensible. The "Z" stands for the extra axis, and is a tribute to "Dogz".

### Project Goals

* Move code to ECMAScript Modules
* Breathe new life into Zdog
	* Maybe fix some bugs
	* Maybe add new features
* Make Zdog easier to extended and use for games
* No major changes to Zdog (See https://zzz.dog/#what-is-zdog)
	* Keep the API friendly
	* Keep the size small
	* Maintain the flat, round design
	* Backwards compatibility whenever possible

### About

Like [Dave (the creator of Zdog)](https://zzz.dog/#about-zdog), I also like to make games and find 3D engines somewhat more powerful and complex
than I typically want to work. I also really enjoyed the aesthetics of Dogz, and enjoy today's flat designs.

## Contributing

* Create issues for bugs, enhancement ideas, questions etc.
* Create PRs if you want to contribute free code changes.

Like Dave, there's a decent chance I'll move on to other projects after some time. Is so please make a hard-fork and keep the library evolving!
